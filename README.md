# memory_game

![Game](/src/gameImage.png)

A simple memory card game I made with html + vanilla ts + Vite.

You can set the number of tiles and back/front tile designs.
When the game is finished you can save the time spent as a score, then on the Scores menu you can see all of them (If you refresh the site they will be erased).

When making this project I had the objective of acquiring proficiency on OOP in mind. 
This was my first attempt at making a complete program made entirely with objects and classes (Vue + Nuxt.js doesn't count, it's all served on a plate for you :p). Hence the design is kinda sloppy (Design patterns, encapsulation? Do you put mayo on that?).
